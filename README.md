    Hey look at that, I finished the to-do list. And now for a short project that for some reason TOP didn't label as a project. Looks like fun anyway. One day project, that is the timeframe I'm putting on it.

    Spent too much time drawing the pictures for this. Maybe should have just done what I did with the restaurant project. Regardless, will be done early tomorrow as I'm basically only adding the image viewer.

DONE-Add slider
-Custom font
-Prettier animations?
-Drag through images on mobile, or click
-Click through images on desktop, or use arrow keys.
