    Hey look at that, I finished the to-do list. And now for a short project that for some reason TOP didn't label as a project. Looks like fun anyway. One day project, that is the timeframe I'm putting on it.

    Spent too much time drawing the pictures for this. Maybe should have just done what I did with the restaurant project. Regardless, will be done early tomorrow as I'm basically only adding the image viewer.

    Lol, "only adding the image viewer." Unfortunatly I got pretty greedy with the look of it, so it was not the quick. Did take less than a day, though. I think I'm switching to seven hours a day of study now, so witch the extra time I should get most of the styling that's left done. But I've been wrong before. And I want to add a dark mode. But hey! I've already got everything set up with variables for colouring!

    Oh and also I want it to work like a story book, change the image and the description changes. Might skip that just to move on.

    Dark mode was super quick and easy, btw. Guess since I did it before, and there's really not a ton that can go wrong.

    As always, start by estimating your development time, then double it. Then double it again. Then, by the time you are done with your project, it will have taken double even that time.

    Text descriptions took like 5 minutes because of everything else that was already set up. I wanted to allow you to really rapidly click through images without smooth scrolling, but that looks like it won't be happening here as I want to move on. Just have to add a basic media query for desktop, and then it's good enough.

    Such a great feeling when go to fix a minor bug, look at your own code, and have no idea how it works. I had hard coded number, which looking back at I have no idea where it came from. Fixed the minor bug, the number is only half hard-coded now. Still not 100% sure how it works, but it does, and it's time to mark this complete and call my grandmother.
